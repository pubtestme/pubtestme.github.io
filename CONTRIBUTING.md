### How to Contribute

The site is currently developed under the [pubtestme organisation on
Github](pubtestme-repo). Contributions come in several types and can take on
several forms:

#### Forms of Contribution

1. [Opening an issue][pubtestme-new-issue] against the site
2. Developing a change and [opening a pull-request][pubtestme-new-pull-req]

[pubtestme-new-issue]: https://github.com/pubtestme/pubtestme.github.io/issues/new
[pubtestme-new-pull-req]: https://github.com/pubtestme/pubtestme.github.io/compare

#### Types of Contribution

1. Corrections-to or flagging-of content
2. Contributing an incident

Contributions correcting or flagging content must contain a concise statement
of the problem. If the contribution is via opening an issue to identify the
defect then the issue must have title identifying the problem, include a link
to the content at hand, and ideally suggest a resolution.

Contributions of new posts should be self contained: There must be a summary of
the activity in question, and at least one of either a formal report or a news
headline to anchor the activity in reality and time. New posts can be
contributed in both issue and pull-request forms. If an issue is opened and the
activity described meets the [material criteria](#material-criteria) then site
administrators will implement the site changes and attribute them to the issue
owner.

Contributions via pull-requests must adhere to the licensing and legal
requirements outlined below.
