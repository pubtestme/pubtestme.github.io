summary: |
  [A story published in the Daily Telegraph][root] claims the "City of Sydney
  Council’s outlay on flights outstrips that of Australia’s foreign ministers",
  but backs the statement with numbers that do not correlate with [the
  report][report] on which they are allegedly based. [The Guardian Australia
  writes][guardian-quote] "In subsequent emails between the Telegraph and
  Moore’s office, the paper justified the figures using a document supplied by
  [Angus] Taylor’s office, purporting to be the council’s annual report."
