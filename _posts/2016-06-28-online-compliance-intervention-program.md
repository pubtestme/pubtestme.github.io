summary: |
  > In July 2016 the Department of Human Services (DHS) - Centrelink - launched
  > a new online compliance intervention (OCI) system for raising and recovering
  > debts. The OCI matches the earnings recorded on a customer’s Centrelink
  > record with historical employer-reported income data from the Australian
  > Taxation Office (ATO). Parts of the debt raising process previously done
  > manually by compliance officers within DHS are now done using this automated
  > process. Customers are asked to confirm or update their income using the
  > online system. If the customer does not engage with DHS either online or in
  > person, or if there are gaps in the information provided by the customer, the
  > system will fill the gaps with a fortnightly income figure derived from the
  > ATO income data for the relevant employment period (‘averaged’ data).
