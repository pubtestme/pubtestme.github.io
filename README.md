[pubtest.me](pubtestme) is an index of reporting on Australian
Federal Government activities that are at odds with the public interest.

If you see incorrect or unsubstantiated information, or think an existing
activity that meets the criteria below should be tracked, please see the
[contributing](/contributing/) page for how to proceed.

Whether an activity is against public interest is measured by meeting one or
more of the following criteria:

1. A public institution has handed down a report that demonstrates an
activity failed to meet legal obligations or required standards. For example,
reports published by the [Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)](anao)

2. An activity that has been reported to disregard advice from relevant public
servants, research or scientific organisations to the detriment of the public

3. Activities reported to [breach ministerial standards as set out by the Department of
the Prime Minister and Cabinet](pmc-ministerial-standards)

4. Activities reported to breach the constitution, federal or state law.
